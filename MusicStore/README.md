# Music Store Database Schema

The database that stores all the data has been realized in MySQL reducing to the bare minimum the number of tables. Some stored procedures have been later on introduced to perform simple in-database operations to move data and calculate simple results. 

# Tables
The database containes 11 tables.
#### Account Tables
These tables contain users and admin data. Every single user, wheters he's a simple customer or a site-admin, is associated to a unique ID, represented by an email, and to a password. Those informations are stored in the *WebUser* (MYSQL:`web_user_bean`) table. If the user is an admin new hypothetical information such as name, surname and phone number are collected and stored in the *Admin* (MYSQL:`admin_bean`) table. If the user is a product producer information such as brand name and address are collected and stored in the *Producer* (MYSQL:`producer_bean`) table. If the user is a simple customer information such as name, surname, address, card number and billing address are collected and stored in the *Customer* (MYSQL:`customer_bean`) table. The three tables *Admin*, *Producer* and *Customer* are related to the *WebUser* table via a foreign key constraint based on the *WebUser* mail attribute. 
#### Product Tables
These tables contain products' data. Each product has a unique ID, name, price and "in-warehouse" quantity, the Product (MYSQL:`product_bean`) table contains all the products. Each product is associated to a producer via foreign key constraint based on WebUser mail attribute, and is also associated to a product category via foreign key category ID constraint. The Category (MYSQL:`category_bean`) table contains a list of all the possible product categories. Since categories can be nested and disposed in a three (i.e. the category "guitar" can be daughter of the category "musical chord instruments" daughter of "musical instruments") I decided to associate to each category: a unique integer ID, a name and the ID of the only parent category. The SoldProducts (MYSQL:`soldprod`) table tracks how many items have been sold: it allowed me to present an home page of "most sold" goods. Each row of SoldProducts references to a product ID via foreign key constraint, to a producer ID via foreign key constraint and saves the number of sold units.
