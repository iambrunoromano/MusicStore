# Backend Application Documentation

The backend application has been built following the MVC pattern and trying to implement the least possible intricate business-logic loops. The backend application provides REST APIs that the frontend application calls. Most of the operations the backend application does are relative to CRUD database operations and to stored procedures calls. If you find this backend application too simple keep in mind that in this project my priority has been to build the most simple, clear and concise code for running a simple e-commerce, while learning SpringBoot and Angular technologies. For the backend application documentation please refer to the [README](https://github.com/iambrunoromano/MusicStore/tree/main/MusicStore/src "Backend README") in the `/src` folder. 

# Database Documentation

The database has been built in the most simple way, not without trial-and-error procedure. It already contains tables that are not stricly useful but I believe in the "building before is better than fixing later" approach. The database has been build with the idea in mind to not only implement "buy and order" functionalities, but also most sold products, best sellers, and administrative accounts. For the database documentation please refer to the [README](https://github.com/iambrunoromano/MusicStore/tree/main/MusicStore/db "Database README") in the `/db` folder.
